This project was made to practice a few basic concepts of ReactJS and was made with reference to a Youtube tutorial.
The link for the Youtube tutorial is right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUe91uOx7R0).

It is a simple photo gallery application which allows you to login with your Google account, upload pictures, view all the pictures.

## Familiarized myself with:
```
1. ReactJS hooks (useState and useEffect)
2. Custom ReactJS hooks
3. Firebase integration for Google Authentication
4. Firestore storage  
```
